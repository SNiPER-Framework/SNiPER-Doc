## Python Configuration and Execution

The Python configuration script is,

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

import Sniper
task = Sniper.Task("task")
task.setEvtMax(3)
task.setLogLevel(3)

import FirstSvc
task.createSvc("FirstSvc/MyService")

import SecondAlg
task.createAlg("SecondAlg")

task.run()
```

And the execution result is,

```
$ python run.py

Please notice that we retrieve the service instance via the name "MyService" in C++, which is not a fixed service type. Then in Python, we assigne the name of the FirstSvc instance as "MyService". 

It's simple to implement a new service with the same API, 

```c++
class SecondSvc : public SvcBase, public IfMySvc
{
    // the definations ...
}
```
And it's simple to replace FirstSvc by SecondSvc in the Python configuration,

```python
#import FirstSvc
#task.createSvc("FirstSvc/MyService")
import SecondSvc
task.createSvc("SecondSvc/MyService")
```

In this way, we can flexibly assemble many DLE modules and add/remove/replace each one of them, just by configuration.
