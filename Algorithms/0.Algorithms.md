# Algorithms

The algorithm is the basic block of a data processing procedure. In this chapter, we will show how to implement and use an algorithm via a very simple example. The content covers the C++ algorithm code and Python configuration. Please see the appendix to find how to setup the environment and compile a package by CMT.
