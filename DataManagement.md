# Data Management

Data management \(DM\) system is designed to manage the event data during offline data processing. It includes the event data model \(EDM\) which defines the event data entity to be processed, the memory manager that holds the EDM objects in memory and the data input/output \(I/O\) system that implements the writing and reading of data files.

SNiPER provides the basic idea and architecture of DM system, on which developers could develop the experiment-specific system based on their requirements. This chapter introduces the basic SNiPER DM architecture as well as the DM system of JUNO \(Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observation\) offline software as an example.
