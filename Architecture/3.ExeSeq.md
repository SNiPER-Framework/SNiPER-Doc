## Execution Sequence

The execution of SNiPER mainly consists of 3 steps, initialize, events loop and finalize. Each step consists some sub-steps as following,

1. initialize
  1. all services are initialized in the order of their creation;
  2. then all algorithms are initialized in the order of their creation;
2. events loop: loop all events. To each event, the following procedures are applied,
  1. broadcast an incident named BeginEvt (begin event);
  2. invoke the execute() method of all algorithms, in the order of their creation;
  3. broadcast an incident named EndEvt (end event);
3. finalize
  1. all algorithms are finalized in the inverted order of their creation;
  2. then all services are finalized in the inverted order of their creation;

The following shows the execution sequence diagram.
